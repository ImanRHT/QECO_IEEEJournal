  The subfigure package has been superseded by the subfig package.
  The reason for the name change is that the new subfig package is not
  exactly backward compatible with this package; although, it comes
  with a configuration file that *almost* allows backward
  compatibility, the difference is that exact spacing and layout of
  the subfloats are not preserved.

  The newer (subfig) package is an improvement over this package and
  although this package will continue to be supported, it will no longer
  be updated.

This directory contains version 2.1.5 of the subfigure package.
Use `make' to extract the subfigure package and run the local tests.

NOTES:
------

By default, the subfigure.sty file acts like the older versions of the
subfigure package.  To make the preferred options default move the
subfigure.cfg file into the standard TEXINPUTS path along with the
subfigure.sty file.  This reduces the whitespace around the subfigures
and subtables and sets the table style to have the captions and
subcaptions preceed the table and subtables.
